# BBC-BASIC
I spent my teens being a nerdy loner, coding on a BBC Micro. I'll add the results of my mis-spent youth here, 
as and when I can retrieve the code from my ancient retro hardware - another project on its own.

Eureka was a kids TV show on BBC in 1982 starring a young Sylvester McCoy. The theme music, as far as I can tell, was in 9/4 time, 
and this was my go at reproducing it for the Beeb.

I've tried to find any kind of copyright reference, but can't, so I assume it's another classic from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.
