# BBC-BASIC
I spent my teens being a nerdy loner, coding on a BBC Micro. I'll add the results of my mis-spent youth here, 
as and when I can retrieve the code from my ancient retro hardware - another project on its own.

Eureka.bas
Eureka was a kids TV show on BBC in 1982 starring a young Sylvester McCoy. The theme music, as far as I can tell, was in 9/4 time, 
and this was my go at reproducing it for the Beeb.

I've tried to find any kind of copyright reference, but can't, so I assume it's another classic from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.

NOTE: This is NOT the game of the same name, available elsewhere.

Sprache.bas
This uses Superior Software's Speech!
It's an attempt to force the speech emulator to pronounce German sentences correctly by converting German vowels, constantants, dipthongs 
and numbers into their British English equivalents.
It's by no means complete - for one thing it only copes with numbers up to 20 and doesn't recognise umlauts, but it's surprisingly effective 
for simple phrases.
